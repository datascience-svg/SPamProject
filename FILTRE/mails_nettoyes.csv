hey i want to share a little of my story with you it wasnt that long ago that i was a developer interested in machine learning i read blogs and websites and did not understand the theory or the math that i thought i needed before i could apply the algorithms i desperately wanted to get started applying machine learning but i was hungup the theory and the academic side and i could not move forward i knew the solution and was using it effectively but it took years to see it for what it was a professional developer it was part of my job to stay top of tools techniques apis and programming languages like many developers i did this by designing and executing small projects the side that used a tool or technique in order for to learn it through applying it it was difficult when my interest in machine learning was kindled there were a few sites out there but nothing that i felt spoke to first someone just plain interested in machine learning and second a professional developer i spent hundreds of dollars thick academic textbooks that i could not understand or appreciate until many years later machine learning is described in academic language from books papers and even websites i felt i now believe wrongly that i had to get higher degrees to figure this stuff out i quit my job and went back to school to earn a masters and phd degrees i completed my research work leveraging the skills i already had a professional developer designing and executing small projects in order to learn and master skills i honestly believe that this skill is all you really need to do well in machine learning and that the higher degrees are a big waste of time unless you love academics and research i came full circle and happily became a professional software developer again i got to solve complex problems with machine learning techniques for real users that were interested and excited about the solutions now i am honored to help interested professional developers like you to get started and become awesome at applied machine learning by writing blog post tutorials and even stepbystep training material thats enough about id love to hear your story and why youre interested in machine learning hit reply and fill in jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hey the way machine learning is taught is crap its backwards books and courses start with the theory and math if there is any time left at the end they might touch how to actually implement or use an algorithm in practice almost no one talks about how to apply machine learning endtoend to actual problems the approach i teach here at machine learning mastery is the other way around i teach machine learning using a topdown process that focuses resultsfirst the result is that you can deliver real value with machine learning a lot sooner which boosts your confidence and skills to continue and take some of the more challenging material with modern tools it is possible to work through small problems in minutes to hours using complex stateoftheart algorithms and rigorous validation and statistical techniques all performed easily and automatically it is after youre familiar and confident with the process that i advise that you start looking deeper into the algorithms and theory side of machine learning now heres a peek at what is coming up for you in this stepbystep crash course youll discover a selfstudy roadmap and activities you should be doing youll discover the foundation definitions and concepts in machine learning youll learn about the process of applied machine learning and the template for each step youll learn how to use top tools and libraries to apply machine learning like weka scikitlearn and r youll learn about deep learning and the xgboost library that is winning competitions youll discover the small projects approach to more advanced selfstudy youll discover why machine learning matters and address your selflimiting beliefs you will be able to work a machine learning problem endtoend using a variety of stateoftheart tools libraries and algorithms and even better you will have the hunger to dive deeper into the details and the confidence to understand and use what you find excited ill speak to you soon jason ps are you ready to take the next step take a look at some of my training materials to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hi machine learning is not just for the academic elite machine learning techniques are just another bag of tools that you can draw upon to solve specific complex problems just like you can use sorting algorithms in libraries to order items in a list you can use machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models and make predictions for new data you dont need a higher degree to apply machine learning in fact you may get to caught up in theory rather than getting results you dont need to know all the math and theory behind an algorithm just enough practical knowledge to use it your problem you dont need permission from a university or the universe before getting started the tools and material are available for you now your boss doesnt really care about some fancy degree they want to know that you have the skills and confidence to deliver a predictive model for a specific problem at work developers just like you are getting started in machine learning every single day they are starting small learning one tool even one algorithm at a time they are building up their bag of tools and portfolio of work to demonstrate they know their stuff you have started this journey now we have to do the work need a little more encouragement take a look at this post what is holding you back from your machine learning goals ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hi you must have a systematic process when working through a predictive modeling problem do you make things up every time you start a new software project the same applies to machine learning you can guarantee at least above average results each predictive modeling problem you encounter by using a systematic process to work through it a good process guides you endtoend from specification to deployment a process is stepbystep so that you always know what to do next a process ensures a good result and results improve all projects the process improves a process is not tied to any specific language library or tool they are a means to an end you dont see much mention about applied machine learning processes because few people are actually working through problems and writing about it a good process template i like to use involves the following steps step define the problem step prepare the data step spot check algorithms step improve results step present results we will go into these steps in more detail in later emails if you would like more see the post process for working through machine learning problems ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hi there are amazing machine learning tools available it never used to be this way we used to have to implement each algorithm ourselves imagine how limiting that was the bugs the small pool of methods to choose from the duplication of effort yuck it is a good idea to pick one tool map it into your systematic process and stick with it until your confident enough to work through a new machine learning problem endtoend some tools that i recommend are weka ideal for oneoff models and beginners because there is no code required scikitlearn in python ideal for developing a model to put into software or a production system caret in r ideal for deedive models and rd work because of the access to a vast number of models these are the tools i recommend to my students just starting out and they are the tools i write the most about with tutorials and more advanced training guides consider picking one of these tools to start with and really focusing it learn how to perform each part of your systematic process using the tool want to know more about the popularity of different machine learning tools see this post best programming language for machine learning ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hi the secret to getting good at applied machine learning is practice work through a lot of different problems its straightforward but you will be surprised by the number of people that just ignore this advice they think the secret is in a textbook or in the math nope that is just procrastination once you have your process and your tool you need to find machine learning which to practice i recommend tabular data like how data looks in an excel spreadsheet because it is much easier to work with i recommend using small datasets that fit into memory i recommend datasets that are already well understood so you know what a good result looks like a good place to find free dataset which to practice is the uci machine learning repository it is a website that lists and allows you to download all of the standard machine learning datasets dont just pick any old dataset carefully design a program of problem types to practice to exercise your tool process and your developing skill set you can learn more about the dataset repository and how to pick good practice datasets in the post practice machine learning with small inmemory datasets ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hey i was a fool i waited years before i felt confident enough to pick up a machine learning tool or library and start working problems i read and reread algorithm descriptions pseudocode and even open source implementations the roadblock i had was that i thought i could not use an algorithm without understanding why it worked i felt like i did not have permission to use an algorithm until i knew it well the authors of the papers and books just thinking about this now makes sad about all the time i wasted learning how to use an algorithm can take minutes or hours and then you can start getting results learning why an algorithm works can take a lifetime so what is your biggest frustration with machine learning right now just hit reply it goes straight to my inbox jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hey if you had to describe machine learning to a friend or colleague how would you do it we know you are interested in machine learning the risk of you chatting about machine learning with someone else is very real heres what i would say if someone asked the valuable part of machine learning is predictive modeling where we use historical data to train a model and use the model to make predictions tom mitchell in his classic book machine learning says the field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience i really like this description it leaves the door open for deeper research questions the nature of automated learning its good to have a machine learning oneliner ready to go see some common definitions of machine learning in the post what is machine learning ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hi there are key concepts in machine learning that lay the foundation for understanding the field i like to break them down into three areas data learning modeling you need to know about data such a data instance data feature and datasets like test and training datasets learning is a big topic induction is the main type of learning used by machine learning algorithms this is generalizing from specific examples with generalizing there is the risk of overlearning too specific and underlearning too general then there is the type of learning such online or offline realtime or batch and supervised or unsupervised teacher or no teacher the model is the artifact created from running an algorithm it is the thing that you can use to describe the structure in the data or make predictions from new data there are two big issues when it comes to the model and that is the bias the assumptions made to create the model and the variance how sensitive it is to data you may have heard of the biasvariance tradeoff that seeks a balance between these two concerns learn more about the standard machine learning terms in the post data learning and modeling ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hey machine learning is a multidisciplinary field and it can be very confusing when you are getting started to differentiate machine learning from closely related fields machine learning is built the field of mathematics and computer science knowing these foundational fields can help you understand why certain mathematical language is used when describing algorithms such vectors matrices functions and distributions specific foundational fields include probability the study of characterizing the likelihood of random events statistics the study of methods to collect analyze describe and present data artificial intelligence the study and construction of computational systems that do things that humans can do or that do things that we think are intelligent machine learning also has sibling fields that sit alongside it these speciality fields give context to machine learning algorithms these include computational intelligence the study and construction of systems that are easy to specify but result in complex emergent behaviors data mining the study and construction of systems that discover interesting relationships from large data sets you can learn more about where machine learning fits in the post where does machine learning fit ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hey i started out wanting to be a machine learning developer that is a developer that built machine learning systems or something i had no idea really i loved programming and when i discovered that there were algorithms that could learn from data i loved them too i wanted to do both at the same time im lucky enough today to work with lots of data and complex models the algorithms are cool and i still love building systems but i learned that i care a lot more about having passionate users and problems that matter than i do about the tech im working i guess i grew up a little bit what would you be doing today if you had already mastered machine learning you can learn more about different machine learning roles in the post find your machine learning tribe jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hi applied machine learning can be overwhelming there are so many things to try and explore a given problem where do you start the answer is to use a structured process just like using a structured process to develop software you are removing uncertainty and ensuring an outcome given your resources it also gives you an idea of what activities to do and when i prescribe a multistep process when using machine learning to address a complex problem the steps are define your problem prepare the data spot check various algorithms tune wellperforming algorithms present results you can use this a template for any machine learning project in fact i recommend it we will dive a little bit deeper into each of these steps in upcoming emails do you want a checklist version of this process see this post how to use a machine learning checklist to get accurate predictions reliably ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr

hey a danger with applied machine learning is diving in and running algorithms the dataset its dangerous because your understanding of the problem is limited which will in turn limit the results you can get there are at least two things you want to do before that point and the first is to clearly define the problem it takes some discipline but it really pays off in getting great results and understanding what they mean like you i usually just want to dive in to speed up the process i like to understand the problem a little bit from many different perspectives use a step approach step what is the problem step why does the problem need to be solved step how would i solve the problem this last step helps you to understand if and why the problem is complex and requires a machine learning based solution do you want to dive deeper into this process see the post how to define your machine learning problem ill speak to you soon jason to make sure you keep getting these emails please add jasonmachinelearningmasterycom to your address book or whitelist us want out of the loop unsubscribe our postal address calle san francisco suite pmb san juan pr
